I've spent a significant chunk of my professional career analyzing media content to understand how media cover different environmental issues. This is a somewhat laborious process in which you carefully read and code hundreds of articles, looking for different frames, etc.

But there's a universe of automated text analysis tools out there that might be really helpful for getting a broad overview of content, even if they can't replace human-led analysis. So I decided to check them out by analyzing a whole bunch of tweets about climate change.
